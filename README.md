# Introduction
This repository contains code to accompany my Medium blog post titled [A Simple Post-Processing Step To Improve The Fairness Of Collaborative Recommender Systems](https://medium.com/@_init_/a-simple-post-processing-step-to-improve-the-fairness-of-collaborative-recommender-systems-4cfbdb47c4ea).

# Prerequistites
The code was developed using Anaconda Python 3.7. 

The calls to PySpark are executed using Databricks's [dbconnect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html) tool.

# Usage
The main results are in the [notebooks](./notebooks) folder. Execute them sequentially. The files ending with `.py` instead of `.ipynb` means that
those are Databricks notebooks.

# Contributing
Feel free to raise an Issue if you have any questions, feedback or comments.
